The artifact evaluation process aims to verify the reproducibility and applicability of the findings outlined in our paper. Our
artifact includes the derivations and explanations of some formulas from the paper to enhance its readability. We also provide
simulation models for 3.5 GHz 2-bit RIS meta-atoms, along with data on phase compensation and reflection coefficients
for four different states, to aid in understanding the RISâ€™s structure and operation. Additionally, we supply all source code
for benchmarks and evaluations, outlining the complete workflow for harmonic generation, attack effect assessment, and
programming RIS for Attack.
