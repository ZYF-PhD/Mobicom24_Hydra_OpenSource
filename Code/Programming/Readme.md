## Introduction

The harmonic MATLAB document contains four parts, namely CreateTable, CreateOrder, FindCode, and Draw. The core purpose of this document is to obtain the expected RIS state transition sequence table and draw the corresponding -1 and +1 order harmonic direction diagrams for verification.

**The order in which the documents are used is:**

CreateTable ------------> CreateOrder ---------------> FindCode ---------------> Draw

If you have previously run the CreateTable and CreateOrder documents to save data offline, you can start directly from FindCode.
