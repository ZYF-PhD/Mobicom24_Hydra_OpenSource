# CreateTable

## Introduction

CreateTable is a MATLAB documentation, It is used to create and save a state transition sequence list under certain constraints, and at the same time save the amplitude and phase of the -1 and +1 order harmonics under the corresponding sequence.

This project aims to save the required data in advance in an offline manner to facilitate subsequent search and calculation.

## Instructions for use

- **Main script: main.m** 
  
  Description: main.m is the main script of the project, responsible for Creating the code table and  amplitude-phase table. 
  
  The script performs the following operations:
  
  Parameter setting: Calculate the relevant parameters in the process of -1, +1 order harmonic amplitude and phase corresponding to the state transition sequence.
  
  Calculation: Traverse the state transition sequence and calculate the corresponding amplitude and phase. Filter the state transition sequence that meets the constraints.
  
  Save results: Save the calculation results to a file.
  
- **Function: EliminateErrors.m**
  
  Description: EliminateErrors.m is used to eliminate system errors.
  
  ```matlab
  function result  = EliminateErrors (input)
   % Input parameters:
   %   input  - A plural
   % Output parameters:
   %   result - After eliminating the error caused by the system,  the return value is still a complex number
  ```
## Additional Notes

The code takes the state transition sequence with the number of states M = 6 as an example. There are 4096 possibilities in total. The total time to build the table is less than 1 second. As M increases, more precise control of phase and amplitude can be achieved. However, the larger the value of ùëÄ, the search space of the state transition sequence increases exponentially.

Offline table creation provides a solution for real-time situations and when M is relatively large.
