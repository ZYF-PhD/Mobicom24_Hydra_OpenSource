# Code

## Introduction

The code is organized into three sub-files: Harmonic Generation, Attack Simulation, and Programming. 

"Harmonic Generation" simulates the underlying principles of harmonic generation. 

"Attack Simulation "assesses the effectiveness and implementation requirements of the attack strategy. 

"Programming" is responsible for generating the RIS state transition sequences tailored to various attack scenarios.
