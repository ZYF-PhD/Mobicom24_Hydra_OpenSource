# RIS model

## Introduction

The model for a 3.5 GHz 2-bit RIS meta-atoms can be directly executed in HFSS to derive S11 and phase parameters. Within the frequency band of 3.45 GHz to 3.55 GHz, the meta-atom exhibits an S11 reflection loss of less than 3.5 dB, with the reflection phase differences across the four states varying by 90 Â± 25 degrees.
